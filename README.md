# Astronautical Engineering Graduation Project
Ground Control Station Design with 3D Visualization.
Explored and evaluated geographic information systems (Google Maps, Mapbox, arcGIS, Bing, Cesium) in Unity, focusing on their ability to provide real-world topographic data. Conducted research to obtain custom heightmap and image data for visualization within the Unity environment. Developed project-specific Unity Shaders with HLSL to incorporate both elevation data and satellite imagery. Strived to create a virtual world representation that closely adheres to the WGS84 standards.
